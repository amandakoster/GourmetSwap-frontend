Library# Gourmet Swap Documentation

***Connecting everyone with great food cooked with love!***

## General Description
Gourmet Swap is an online platform for connecting local chefs and their neighbors for a variety of culinary services from preparation of nutritious home-cooked meals to cooking classes to catering.  Often our days are filled with work, kids and events leaving little time for healthy eating.  Gourmet Swap offers a convenient, healthier alternative to fast food and take-out.  Users browse meals and services available in their neighborhoods and can place orders for pickup and delivery.

## Technical Description
Gourmet Swap lives on the MERN stack.  The React front-end is server agnostic and relies on an independent RESTful API back-end utilizing the Express web application framework on Node.JS with the MongoDB NoSQL database server.  The MERN stack is highly scalable within the context of Platform as a Service (PaaS) providers, such as Heroku where both the front-end and back-end are currently deployed.  Much of the static content is provided via the AWS S3 content delivery network.

### Technical Documentation

#### Front-end

##### Views
- The views are handled in a component architecture.

##### Redux
 - Redux.js is a predictable state container that requires *actions* (plain objects) to be dispatched in order to change the application state.  The state cannot be modified directly.  This provides predictability, i.e. the same actions in the same order will produce the same results.

##### React
 - React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

 - React uses a declarative paradigm that makes it easier to reason about your application. React computes the minimal set of changes necessary to keep your DOM up-to-date. React works with the libraries and frameworks that you already know.

 - To describe component's DOM representations, React uses an XML-like syntax called JSX. JSX is not required to use React, but it makes code more readable, and writing it feels like writing HTML. A simple transform is included with React that allows converting JSX into native JavaScript for browsers to digest.

##### React-Redux Reducers
The reducer is a pure function that takes the previous state and an action, and returns the next state.
- **auth**
- **cook-form**
- **meal**
- **route**

##### React-Redux Actions
Actions describe the fact that something happened, but don't specify how the application's state changes in response.
- **cook-form**
- **cook-register**
- **meal-form.test**
- **meal-reducer.test**

##### React-Redux Libraries

### Creators
Gourmet Swap started in 2016 with two entrepreneurs, Ezon and Fagner. Ezon is from Seattle, WA. He is the Founder of Gourmet Swap. Fagner is from Brazil, he is a partner of the User experience design team.   They were inspired to start Gourmet Swap by a Facebook group called “San Diego Foodie Fest” with over 20k subscribers that serves as a marketplace for buying and selling home cooked meals.

Hailing from a strong creative background, I am motivated by the constraints of design and wizardry of code. After working with several large companies I found a disconnect between producers, UX, and devs. I became a Full Stack JavaScript Developer in order to speak both languages and bridge this gap.

#### Matthew Parker
Hi, I'm Matthew Parker! I'm a writer and Full-Stack JavaScript developer. I've pursued both of these passions because I love to create, and with these skills I'm able to imagine a thing, and then write it into existence. I'd rather be doing nothing else!

#### Zachary Diehl
An operations leader turned technologist, I plan to use my past experience to develop and lead small development teams to solve real human problems.  Technology is amazing, but it is only as beneficial as the problems it solves for society.

#### Steve Walsh
I bring business and coding experience together to build big things and solve complex problems!  I love working on a team committed to collaboration, success, and mutual growth.  My joys are building RESTful backends and learning new technologies.
